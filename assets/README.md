This is a simple TicTacToe game. It must be played with two people. The first person is an ‘X’ marker and the second person is an ‘O’ marker. Each player take turns making a move on the board. Once one of the players fill a row, a column or a diagonal on the board with their marker, that player wins and the game is over. The user doesn’t have to sign in to play, but they will if they want to be able to save the same to the server.

The board was created using HTML & CSS. and a tad bit of bootstrap. The game logic was created using javascript and jQuery. This game works by adding and hiding classes in HTML using JQuery. After four turns, javascript will run through each win condition and if theres a winner, it will display who won and clear the board using JQuery.

Unsolved:
- Change password
- GET game information from the server
- Centering the game board
- Prevent player from making additional moves after the game was over. I had to hide the board to get around this issue.






As a user I want:
To be able to log in and log off.
To be able to click on a square in the game board to make my make.
To be able to see whose turn it is to make a move.
To be able to see which player won.
To be able to start a new game anytime.
